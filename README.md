Thanks  for  [@LorenzoBianconi](https://github.com/LorenzoBianconi)'s great  work，now the USB wireless  dongles  with mt7612u  such as Netgear-A6210  could work on Ubuntu  now. The driver has been tested on Ubuntu16.04 (kernel 4.13.0-43-generic) and it works well.

$ git clone https://github.com/romayiii/A6210-mt76x2u_Ubuntu.git
$ cd A6210-mt76x2u_Ubuntu
